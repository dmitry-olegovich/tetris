Bugs:
	+ figures can be put out of area bounds by rotating
	+ lines not removed correctly (maybe line needs to be above bottom for this)
	+ lines are not shifted correctly (maybe line needs to be above bottom for this)
	+ next figures not shown correctly
	+ figures need to rotate clockwise instead
	- some figures have a wierd center or laterally move when only rotated
	+ at rotation of figure on the right side playing field: 
		in check_rotation 
		if self._array[cell.y][cell.x]:
		IndexError: list index out of range
	+ endgame condition check is wierd - doesn't end at the moment it should
	+ increase of speed is only done if lines are up to it from speed 1
